# Movie - Recommender System
### Based on combined effect of user-user and movie-user collaborative filtering

## Overall Implementation of movie - recommender system is divided into 3 benchmarks
### 1. Part 1 
    - Predicting Top 10 movies for a given movie 
    - Cross-checking the above list via Googleâ€™s Gemini

### 2. Part 2 
    - Validating matrix-factorization models are superior to classic 
      nearest-neighbor techniques for producing product recommendations
    - Minimizing the difference predicted and actual ratings via two 
      performance metric : RMSE and MAPE

```
### 3. Part 3
    - Using SVD matrix-factorization model for predicting Top 10 
      unwatched movies for a given user and a given watched movie
    - Comparing my SVD model via current SOTA algorithm
